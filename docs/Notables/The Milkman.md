_"The Milkman", it's impossible for you to not at least heard of the name. He stands at the fine line of the shadows of Seattle. A litmus test for the up-and-coming and the fallen alike. If you're new to this blasted criminal gig economy, or have fucked up so bad no-one trusts you. He's more or less the man to try to get a job from. Whatever your current situation. Building a little bit of good track record with him is your first step to properly enter the shadows; The gateway to other fixers to be willing to take a risk on you. On the flipside,....have a major fuckup or simply not meet his standards....._
